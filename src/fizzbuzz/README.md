FizzBuzz

Basically, this is how it works: you print the integers from
    $1$ to $N$, replacing any of them divisible
    by $X$ with Fizz or, if they are divisible by $Y$, with Buzz. If the number is divisible by both
    $X$ and $Y$, you print FizzBuzz instead.

Input

Input contains a single test case. Each test case contains
    three integers on a single line, $X$, $Y$ and $N$ ($1
    \leq X < Y \leq N \leq 100$).

$X$

$Y$

$N$

$1
    \leq X < Y \leq N \leq 100$

Output

Print integers from $1$
    to $N$ in order, each on
    its own line, replacing the ones divisible by $X$ with Fizz, the ones divisible by $Y$ with Buzz and ones divisible by both $X$ and $Y$ with FizzBuzz.
